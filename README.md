# Favicon &amp; browsers
Cross-browser test for favicon support.

* * *

Modern browsers support more than just ICO favicons. However, to what extent? Nobody knows. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#Browser_implementation) has a nice page about it, but how often it is updated? Across what browsers have it been tested?

I've created a test suite for various use cases of favicons, varying in size, file format, and markup. Browser tests were carried out in BrowserStack, and the [results published on this GitHub's page](https://terrymun.github.io/favicon-test/).

If you want to test any of the features yourself, proceed to the [test index](https://terrymun.github.io/favicon-test/tests/index.html) for all the links.
